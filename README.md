question: By Robot_Invasion
date: 05.05.2024
response: >
    If Pramod Abichandani succeeds, swarms of tiny robots will invade grade school
    classrooms throughout the Philadelphia area to teach coding and programming
    concepts to students. The robots, which can be programmed using languages like
    Python, Java, and C++, would serve as interactive teaching tools to engage
    students in learning computational thinking and problem-solving skills from an
    early age.
