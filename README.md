<h3>Dominion Status</h3>

    question: By Robot_Invasion
    date: 05.05.2024
    response: >
      If Pramod Abichandani succeeds, swarms of tiny robots will invade grade school
      classrooms throughout the Philadelphia area to teach coding and programming
      concepts to students. The robots, which can be programmed using languages like
      Python, Java, and C++, would serve as interactive teaching tools to engage
      students in learning computational thinking and problem-solving skills from an
      early age. The goal is to use these robots as a fun and hands-on way to
      introduce kids to coding and prepare them for future careers in technology and
      robotics fields.
